This repo is a collection of various experiments and projects I've worked on related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Analysis, and Machine Learning. It includes a variety of scripts and techniques for processing and analyzing text, such as tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging, sentiment analysis, n-grams, and more.
