            " The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.\n",
            "It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders.\n",
            "Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long.\n",
            "It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females.\n",
            "A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding.\n",
            "It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements.\n",
            "It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.\n",
            " \n",
            "The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft).\n",
            "It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons.\n",
            "It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees.\n",
            "Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months.\n",
            "The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.\n",
            " \n",
            "As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.\n",
            "The wild population has increased again to 1,864 individuals as of March 2015.\n",
            "Since 2016, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.\n",
            "In July 2021, Chinese authorities also classified the giant panda as vulnerable.\n",
            "It is a conservation-reliant species.\n",
            "By 2007, the captive population comprised 239 giant pandas in China and another 27 outside the country.\n",
            "It has often served as China's national symbol, appeared on Chinese Gold Panda coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing.\n",
            " \n",
            "The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.[3]\n",

            "The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya[59] while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya,[60] signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.[62]\n",

            "Scent marks and odors are used to spread information about sexual status, whether a female is in estrus or not, age, gender, individuality, dominance over territory, and choice of settlement.[84] Giant pandas communicate by excreting volatile compounds, or scent marks, through the anogenital gland.[84][85]\n",
            "Giant pandas have unique positions in which they will scent mark.\n",
            "Males deposit scent marks or urine by lifting their hind leg, rubbing their backside, or standing in order to rub the anogenital gland onto a landmark.\n",

            "Chemical signals can have different functions in different seasons.\n",
            "During the non-breeding season, females prefer the odors of other females because reproduction is not their primary motivation.\n",
            "However, during breeding season, odors from the opposite sex will be more attractive.[87][88] Because they are solitary mammals and their breeding season is so brief, female pandas secrete chemical cues in order to let males know their sexual status.[88]\n",
            "The chemical cues female pandas secrete can be considered to be pheromones for sexual reproduction.[88] Females deposit scent marks through their urine which induces an increase in androgen levels in males.[88]\n",
            "Androgen is a sex hormone found in both males and females; testosterone is the major androgen produced by males.\n",
            "Civetone and decanoic acid are chemicals found in female urine which promote behavioral responses in males; both chemicals are considered giant panda pheromones.[88]\n",
            "Male pandas also secrete chemical signals that include information about their sexual reproductivity and age, which is beneficial for a female when choosing a mate.[84][87]\n",
            "For example, age can be useful for a female to determine sexual maturity and sperm quality.[89] Pandas are also able to determine when the signal was placed, further aiding in the quest to find a potential mate.[89]\n",
            "However, chemical cues are not just used for communication between males and females, pandas can determine individuality from chemical signals.\n",
            "This allows them to be able to differentiate between a potential partner or someone of the same sex, which could be a potential competitor.[89]\n",
            " Chemical cues, or odors, play an important role in how a panda chooses their habitat.\n",
            "Pandas look for odors that tell them not only the identity of another panda, but if they should avoid them or not.[89]\n",
            "Pandas tend to avoid their species for most of the year, breeding season being the brief time of major interaction.[89] Chemical signaling allows for avoidance and competition.[86][87]\n",
            "Pandas whose habitats are in similar locations will collectively leave scent marks in a unique location which is termed \"scent stations\".[89]\n",
            "When pandas come across these scent stations, they are able to identify a specific panda and the scope of their habitat.\n",
            "This allows pandas to be able to pursue a potential mate or avoid a potential competitor.[89]\n",
            " Pandas can assess an individual's dominance status, including their age and size, via odor cues and may choose to avoid a scent mark if the signaler's competitive ability outweighs their own.[86]\n",
            "A panda's size can be conveyed through the height of the scent mark.[86][90] Since larger animals can place higher scent marks, an elevated scent mark advertises a higher competitive ability.\n",
            "Age must also be taken into consideration when assessing a competitor's fighting ability.\n",
            "For example, a mature panda will be larger than a younger, immature panda and possess an advantage during a fight.[86]\n",
            " Giant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20.[91]\n",
            "The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year.[92] When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind.\n",
            "Copulation time ranges from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilisation.\n",
            "The gestation period is somewhere between 95 and 160 days - the variability is due to the fact that the fertilized egg may linger in the reproductive system for a while before implanting on the uterine wall.[92] Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies.[93]\n",
            "If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild.\n",
